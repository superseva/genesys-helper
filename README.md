# genesys-helper

Adding couple of helpers methods for Genesys FoundryVTT

You can push new icons by adding them to existing array of icons:
` CONFIG.statusEffects.unshift("assets/genesys/die/b.png");`

Or completely override the icons with yours:

`CONFIG.statusEffects = ["assets/genesys/die/b.png", "assets/genesys/die/s.png", "assets/genesys/die/c.png"]`
